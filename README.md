- **TypeScript**: This project is configured to use TypeScript for static type checking.
- **ESLint and Prettier**: The project is set up with ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting.
- **Husky and lint-staged**: These tools are used to ensure that all committed code is linted and formatted.
- **Commitizen and commitlint**: These tools are used to enforce conventional commit messages.
